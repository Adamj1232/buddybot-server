# WebSocket Module

## Overview
This module manages WebSocket connections from clients, including connection establishment, message handling, and connection health monitoring.

## Components
- ConnectionManager: Tracks active connections
- MessageHandler: Processes and routes messages
- HeartbeatService: Monitors connection health

## Key Functions
- `handle_connection(socket: WebSocket, user_id: Uuid) -> Result<()>`
- `send_message(user_id: Uuid, message: Message) -> Result<()>`
- `broadcast(message: Message) -> Result<()>`
- `close_connection(user_id: Uuid) -> Result<()>`

## Implementation Details
Connections are managed using Tokio's async runtime. Each connection is handled in its own task, with a shared connection pool tracking all active connections.
